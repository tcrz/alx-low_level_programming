# Singly linked lists #

## What is a linked list? ##
*A linked list is the sequence of linked lists which are connected with each other through links.
 Linked list in C is a linear data structure where the data is stored at different locations and they are linked using pointers. You have to use pointers to implement the linked list data structure.

A linked list can be defined as a collection of connected nodes. It is a linear data structure. A linked list contains two parts such as:-
* **Data Part**: Contains the data of the user
* **Pointer Part**: It points to the next member of the linked list*


* 0-print_list.c is a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

* 1-list_len.c is a a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

* 2-add_node.c is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

* 3-add_node_end.c is a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

* 4-free_list.c is a function that frees a list_t list.

* 100-first.c is a function that prints a sentence before the main function is executed.

* 101-hello_holberton.asm is 64-bit program in assembly that prints "Hello, Holberton", followed by a new line.

* lists.h is the header file containing the definition of the list_t struct and all the prototypes of the above functions.
